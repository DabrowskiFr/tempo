[driver] instant 0: emit guard_a to wake the first listener
[listener/A] instant 0: guard present, branch resumes in parallel
[driver] instant 1: emit guard_a and guard_b in the same instant
[listener/A] instant 1: guard present, branch resumes in parallel
[listener/B] instant 0: guard present, branch resumes in parallel
[combo] instant 1: guard_a et guard_b présents dans le même instant
[driver] instant 2: final emission of guard_a
[listener/B] instant 1: done observing guard
[combo] instant 2: combo branch done
[listener/A] instant 2: guard present, branch resumes in parallel
[driver] instant 3: all signals emitted
[listener/A] instant 3: done observing guard
[scenario] all parallel branches completed
